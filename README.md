# 🧪 Predicting Diabetes Risk with Imputation, EDA & Logistic Regression

Diabetes isn't just a number; it’s a growing global health concern. The earlier it’s predicted, the better the chance of intervention. 

In this project, I tackled the classic **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**, applying **imputation techniques**, in-depth **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and a suite of **logistic regression models** to explore what drives diabetes risk, and how to predict it more accurately. This project is mainly to showcase how I deal with implausible data before modelling.

📊 completed as part of **Statistics and Machine Learning module** for the MSc Data Science at **The University of Manchester**.

## 🧭 Project Workflow

### 🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Histogram & boxplot visualisation** revealed outliers and skewed distributions.
- **Pairplots** showed that diabetic patients typically score higher across most indicators.
- **Correlation matrix** highlighted Glucose as the most predictive feature, followed by Insulin and Age.

### 🔧 2. Missing Value Imputation

### 🧪 3. Regression Model Development & Comparison
